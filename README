MM5TOGEM version 1.2  8/7/2001
  (ovens@atmos.washington.edu 
   ftp://ftp.atmos.washington.edu/ovens/mm5togem.20010807.tar)

The basic things you need to do (after gunzipping and untarring the file):
  try "make"
  read and edit the input_file
  run it.

LINUX notes (added 8/7/2001):
  on Linux, I had to do the following:
  1) build GEMPAK (I used version 5.6.C.1) and I used the standard g77
     version.  This required:
     1.a) using RedHat (7.0), I added the OpenMotif RPMs from RedHat
          7.1: openmotif-2.1.30-8.i386.rpm and 
               openmotif-devel-2.1.30-8.i386.rpm
          I obtained these from ftp://redhat.cac.washington.edu and used
          rpm -I to install them as superuser.
     1.b) made sure that config/Makeinc.linux had
          MOTIFLIBS = -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXm $(X11LIBDIR) -lSM -lICE -lXp -lXext
     1.c) make clean all install >& make.out
  2) I had to create a version of MCHPRM.PRM that worked with pgf90.
     This file is included as MCHPRM.PRM.linux and it was patterned
     after the SunOS version.
  3) Makefile.Linux and Makefile have been updated to link in the
     appropriate MCHPRM.PRM file.  Now simply type "make".
  4) NOTE: because GEMPAK was built with g77 and mm5togem was built
     with pgf90 -lg2c, the iargc() and getarg() features do not work!
     This could be remedied, I believe, by building GEMPAK with
     pgf90, but that is something for the future.
   
Sample Data (added 8/7/2001):
  I have sample data available at
  ftp://ftp.atmos.washington.edu/ovens/mm5togem_sample_data.tar.gz
  This can be downloaded to test your version.


This program took off from some code from Utah.  It is a hodgepodge
and is released with absolutely no guarantees of any sort.

There are also some sample scripts and input_files in sample_scripts/.

Good luck.

******** Utah Code README ************************************************

This program converts output from TERRAIN, DATAGRID, RAWINS, INTERP(mminput),
and MM5 to gempak format.  It also will interpolate the sigma level data from
MM5 and INTERP output to pressure levels if requested.  During the pressure 
level interpolation, values below ground will be extrapolated or set to lowest 
sigma level values, depending on the variable.  All data is written out on the 
dot point domain.  Cross point variables are interpolated to the dot point 
domain.

The code is based on a similar program written at SUNY Brockport, also called
conv.  Major changes have been made to their code and they are in no way
responsible for any possible bugs in this code.

#############################################################################
Directions:
#############################################################################

1) Edit the script "compile" if necessary to set up the proper links,
library paths and optimizations.  Compile the program with the command:
	compile conv

2) Run the program.  No command line arguements are necessary.  The program
will ask all the questions it needs answered.  The questions should be
self-explanatory, but may vary depending on whether the output gempak file
already exists or not.  Some command line arguements can be used.  Either
look in the code, or type "conv -help" (actually -anything-you-want will work)
to get a listing of the command line arguements accepted.

#############################################################################

Caution:  If the model arrays are too large or the number of output times is 
too many, the first parameter statement in the code will need to be changed.  

Caution:  If the map projection used in the MM5 is not Lambert Conic Conformal,
some adjustments to the code may be needed.  It may work for Polar 
Stereographic but has never been tested.  It does not work for Mercator 
projections.

Caution:  The limit to the number of grids in a gempak file is usually 3999.  
Very large MM5 output files may need to be run for hours 0-12, 12-24, 24-36,
etc., or they may be separated into pressure coordinate and sigma coordinate
files.

The output pressure levels can be changed by changing the values of the array
plevs and adjusting the parameter kzp to be the right size.  


Precipitation fields written out are the following:

Total accumulated convective parameterized precipitation(cm):  CXXM
Total accumulated explicit parameterized precipitation(cm):    EXXM
Total accumulated explicit + convective precipitation(cm):     PXXM

Additionally, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hour precipitation is written out.  These
grids are labeled as C01M,E01M,P01M,  C03M,E03M,P03M, etc.  The increments
can be adjusted by changing the array iptimes in the code.  Values of 99 in
the iptimes array will be ignored.

If output interval from MM5 is not divisible by 60 minutes (i.e. 15, 30, or
90 minutes output interval), C00M, E00M, and P00M may be output.  These are
all precip totaled since the last output.  For example, if tape frequency
is 15 minutes, P00M is 15 minute total precip.  To write out these recent
precip grids, one item in the iptimes array should be 0.


The interpolation/extrapolation to pressure levels is done in the subroutine
pintp.  The last arguement in the subroutine call to pintp for each variable
determines the type of extrapolation to be done below the surface.  If changes
are desired, see the subroutine pintp for possible changes.  Extrapolation is
only intended to be aesthetically pleasing in regions of high topography on
850, and 700 mb plots, etc., which would otherwise have gaps in data.  Above
the surface, extrapolation is linear in log of pressure between half-sigma
levels.

All PARMs with VCORD of PRES are interpolated from the MM5 model's
sigma vertical coordinate system.  When vertical coordinate = ZAGL, or
height above ground level, these PARMs are actually the values on the
model's lowest sigma level, which is roughly a constant height (40 Meters)
above ground level.
